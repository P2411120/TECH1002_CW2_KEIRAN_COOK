    <p> I'm Keiran and I've now been playing Guitar since i was 12, so thats 13 years making me 25, and gigging the local
    pub circuit since i was 15 with a slight hiatus recently due to the pandemic obviously! From the age of 18 i joined
    a band called Kashmire later changing the name to The Killing Culture and toured the UK with the likes of The Treatment
    who have toured with bands such as Motley Crue, Aerosmith and Alice Cooper. Since then i started a band
    called Chivalry creating a bit of interest within the pop punk scene, again touring the UK. Finally in 2019
    i ended up in The Bad Sundays, a rock/indie band that have won multiple battle of the bands and gained interviews with BBC
    Radio stations.

    Why not learn something new this year with the Guitar.. </p>
