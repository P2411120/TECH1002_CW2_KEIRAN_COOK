<p> I could drag on about the guitar orignating from over 3000 years ago but steel strings first became widely available in
  around 1900. Steel strings offered the promise of much louder guitars,
  but the increased tension was too much for the Torres-style fan-braced top. A beefed-up X-brace proved equal to the job,
   and quickly became the industry standard for the flat-top steel string guitar.At the end of the 19th century
   Orville Gibson was building archtop guitars with oval sound holes. He married the steel-string guitar with a body
   constructed more like a cello, where the bridge exerts no torque on the top, only pressure straight down. This allows the
    top to vibrate more freely, and thus produce more volume. In the early 1920's designer Lloyd Loar joined Gibson, and
    refined the archtop "jazz" guitar into its now familiar form with f-holes, floating bridge and cello-type tailpiece.

The electric guitar was born when pickups were added to Hawaiian and "jazz" guitars in the late 1920's, but met with
little success before 1936, when Gibson introduced the ES150 model, which Charlie Christian made famous.With the advent
 of amplification it became possible to do away with the soundbox altogether. In the late 1930's and early 1940's
 several actors were experimenting along these lines, and controversy still exists as to whether Les Paul, Leo Fender,
 Paul Bigsby or O.W. Appleton constructed the very first solid-body guitar. Be that as it may, the solid-body electric guitar
 was here to stay.</p>
